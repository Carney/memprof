What is memprof?
================
Memprof is a memory profiler for Ruby that requires no patches to the Ruby VM.
It can help you find Ruby level memory leaks in your application.

Required to install
===================
If you are using the Linux version, you need to install libelf:

apt-get install libelfg0-dev

The experimental OSX version needs no additional libraries.

How to use
==========

require 'memprof'
Memprof.start

# ruby code

Memprof.stats

# more ruby code

Memprof.stats
Memprof.stop


The above code will output 2 summaries, allowing you to compare which objects were
destroyed and which are still around.

Memprof.stats also takes an (optional) file name to write the output to a file.
