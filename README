What is memprof?
================

Memprof hopes to become a memory profiler for Ruby that will work without
modifying your Ruby binary. You just require the gem and off you go.


When will it be done?
=====================

No idea, but soon I hope.

Why release this then?
======================

This gem illustrates an ugly hack that I thought might interest other people.
