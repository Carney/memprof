What is memprof?
================
Memprof is a memory profiler for Ruby that requires no patches to the Ruby VM.
It can help you find Ruby level memory leaks in your application.

How to use
==========

require 'memprof'
Memprof.start

# ruby code

Memprof.stop
Memprof.dump

That will monitor allocations and frees that happen between "start" and "stop"
and will output information to standard error.

Memprof.dump also takes an (optional) file name to write the output to a file.
